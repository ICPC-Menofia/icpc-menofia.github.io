Competitive programming is a mind sport where participants solve algorithmic problems under time constraints. It helps develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and coding efficiency - all valuable in software development careers.  I'm a complete beginner. Can I still join? Absolutely! We welcome students of all skill levels. Our Newcomer Training program is specifically designed for beginners with no prior experience in competitive programming.  What programming languages can I use? The most popular languages in competitive programming are C++ and Python. We recommend starting with C++ as it's widely used in contests, but you can use any language you're comfortable with. Check our [training resources](#) for language-specific guidance.  How much time commitment is required? It depends on your goals and current level. **Beginners** might spend 5-10 hours per week on learning and practice, while **advanced participants** may dedicate 15+ hours weekly to intensive training and contests.  Do I need to be enrolled at Menofia University to join? While our community is primarily for Menofia University students, we welcome anyone interested in competitive programming. However, **only enrolled Menofia students** are eligible to compete in university-represented contests like ECPC and ACPC.  What contests will I be able to participate in? As a community member, you can participate in online contests (Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.) and local training sessions. **Enrolled Menofia students** can also compete in official university contests like ECPC and ACPC. Check our [events page](#) for more details.  How can I track my progress and improvement? We recommend maintaining profiles on platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder to track your rating and solved problems. Additionally, our **mentors provide personalized feedback** during training sessions and can help assess your development areas."},{"location":"resources/sessions/","title":"Community Sessions Archive","text":"<p>Welcome to the central hub for all our community session recordings.
